# A short, descriptive name of this building block collection
name: OGC Building Blocks for DCAT-AP-NL 3.0 - EPERIMENTAL

# Short abstract for this collection (optional)
abstract: |
  These building blocks are an experimental implementation of DCAT-AP-NL.

# Description for this collection (optional)
description: |
  The purpose of this collection is to experiment with the building block approach and to showcase how
  this potentially can add value.

  Note: the building blocks in the geonovum repository are a more conservative implementation while the 
  building blocks in this repository are more experimental.

# Customize the following prefix (will be prepended to the path of the building blocks):
